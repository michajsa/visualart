        <p>With grand sense of adventure, Charles and Ray turned their curiosity and boundless enthusiams into creations that establish then as a truly great husband and wife design team. Their unique synergy led to a whole new look in furniture. Lean and modern. Playful and functional. Sleek, sophisticated and beautifully simple. That was and is the "Eames look."</p>
        <img src="img/chair1.png" alt="side view of chair">
        <p>"That look and their relationship with Herman Miller started with moulded plywood chairs in the late 1940s and included the world-renowned Eames lounge chair, now in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York"</p>
        <p>"Charles and Ray achieved their monumental success by approaching each project the same way:Does it interest and intrigue us? Can we make it better?"</p>

        <p class="personal-quote">"Choose your corner, pick away at it carefully, intensely &amp; to the best of your ability, &amp; that way, you might change the world" <br> <span>- Charles Eames</span></p>
        <p>"The loved their work, which was a combination of art and science, design and architechture, process and product, style and function."The details are not details", said Charles."They make the product".</p>

        <p>"Their own concepts evolved over time, not overnight. As Charles noted about the development of the Moulded Plywood Chairs,"Yes, it waas a flash if inspiration", he said, "a kind of 30-year flash."</p>
        <p>"A design critic ounce said that this extraordinary couple "just wanted to make the world a better place". That they did. That also made it a lot more interesting."</p>
